Feature: User deletes account
  As a OpenHouse User
  So that I can stop using OpenHouse
  I want to delete my account
  
Background: a user has been created in the database
  Given the following accounts exist:
    | email                   | password | billing_street_address | billing_city | billing_state  | billing_zip_code | first_name | last_name | credit_card_number | expiration_date | cvv |

Scenario: delete account
  Given I am on the login page
  And I fill in "Email" with "aladdin@agrabah.com"
  And I fill in "Password" with "12341001"
  When I press "Log In"
  And I follow "Edit Profile"
  And I am on the edit page
